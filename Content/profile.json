"Project1": {
    "Title": "Interesting Project 1",
    "Desc": "This web crawling project includes the creation of a program that is designed to 
    explore and navigate websites through a provided link, with the purpose of gathering 
    information from them. This program functions by scanning numerous web pages and 
    links that can be found on the initial website. From here it will create a beautiful 
    graph displaying the nodes which resemble the pages found. As well as the edges 
    that are the links found from the website, which show the connection between each node
    node and how they interconnected through each website. As seen through the graph all of 
    the edges have the same weight, and we did not use weight as the depth. Once the graph 
    is created, the program will continue to calculate the closeness centrality of each 
    node(webpage) which is the proximity of node based on the shortest path to the rest of 
    the nodes in the graph. With this web crawling program and its visial represention, one
    can gain a deeper understanding of a websites interconnectivity as well as its organization.",
